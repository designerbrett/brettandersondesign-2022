			<h3>Objectives</h3>
			<p>I didn’t want a traditional wedding photo album look. I wanted to push things in a more high fashion and editorial direction. It needed to be explorational, typographic, and visually stunning. The printing had to be large and give that heavy high-quality appearance.</p>

			<p class="editorial">Being the designer that I am I couldn't help but be excited for the opportunity to create this book. I was especially excited because I could work with some amazing photography. The expectations I put on myself for this book were very high and that didn't help the timeline of this project.</p>
			
			<h2 class="editorial">Process</h2>
			<p>
			
			<img class="float-left third"  alt="A screenshot of some of the inspirational designs I looked at." src="../../images/wedding-book/wedding-inspo.png"
     />
			
			<h3>Visual Inspiration</h3>Inspiration was gathered from Pinterest searching for high fashion layouts. I basically wanted it to look like a wedding magazine but with a little fewer article write-ups. This help gets a sense of what kind of cropping or even photo selection I would need to be looking for. Not all the images are my wife's favorites but I think she came to love the finished result.</p>
			
			<p><img class="float-right third" alt="A screenshot of some of the quotes used in the book." src="../../images/wedding-book/wedding-quotes.png"><h3>Quotes Inspiration</h3>Every page has some sort of quote or saying which were also collected from Pinterest (secret board for sure) as well. Here are some examples, one of my favorites is "I think you are more beautiful than Helvetica." and "Together is our favorite place to be. Or In-N-Out (The fast-food burger restaurant)."</p>
			
			<p class="editorial ">The book was designed in Adobe InDesign and most of the masking was done there as well. A few of the type treatments were created in Illustrator and exported over. Many of the images were photoshopped and masked out there to help with some of the gradients and transition styles.</p>
			
			<div class="clear">
				<img alt="Notes made on print out of a spread." class="fourth lozad" src="../../images/wedding-book/wedding-sketch-01.jpg" /><img alt="Notes made on print out of a spread." class="fourth lozad" src="../../images/wedding-book/wedding-sketch-03.jpg" /><img alt="Notes made on print out of a spread." class="half lozad" src="../../images/wedding-book/wedding-sketch-02.jpg" />
				<p class="editorial caption text-center">The images above showcase some of the sketches and edits made through out different parts of the design process.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="editorial clear">After 6 years of off and on work the 80-page wedding book is complete and printed. There were quite a few long breaks that didn’t help the design process. This is just a small sample of spreads that I think were really successful and have sentimental value.</p>

				<p class="caption">A focus on typography and layout with the partially masked image.</p>

				<img alt="A spread of my wife and I outside of the LDS Newport Beach Temple" src="../../images/wedding-book/wb-03.jpg" />
				<p class="caption">Simple layout with two full page images. Example of the circle quote design.</p>

			</div><div class="third">
				<img alt="A spread of close up cut out accessories that my wife was wearing" src="../../images/wedding-book/wb-05.jpg" />
				<p class="caption">I really enjoyed this spread and collaging together the different accessories my wife was wearing.</p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://e.issuu.com/embed.js" async="true"></script>
			<p class="editorial">Book was printed through <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://blurb.com">Blurb</a>, large lay-flat photo book. Great quality, highly recommended.</p>

			<h2 class="editorial">Lessons Learned</h2>
			<p class="editorial">Set better expectations, overall planning and sticking to any sort of timeline. Being more of a personal passion project it definitely got the back seat as other paying projects came in or children were born. My style and thus the book went through a few different style directions and that meant having to rethink a lot of the spreads to adapt. Had I got this done in a year or two I think this consistency issue wouldn't have been as painful. Being a project that I am the biggest critic of it was hard the last couple months to find the point that it's good enough, I could play with layouts for another six years.</p>
